# Trend Detector

Private trend detection pipeline. Runs daily, scores rising search trends, outputs a JSON file and a plain-English morning briefing.

**Data sources (3-layer):**
1. **trendspy** — real-time trending via Google's internal API (no auth, no waitlist)
2. **Google Trends RSS** — `trending/rss?geo=US` (public, stdlib XML parse)
3. **Gmail newsletter** — Google Trends daily email parsed via IMAP + BeautifulSoup

Trends appearing in 2+ sources get a confidence boost. Keywords are filtered, scored, clustered into macro-themes, validated against Reddit, and analyzed into a morning briefing.

**Pipeline stages:**
1. Collect from all 3 sources
2. Cross-reference — merge duplicates; multi-source hits get +20/+40 confidence boost
3. Filter — strip brands, sports, entertainment, news events, person names
4. Score — 0–100 composite (35% growth velocity, 25% buildability, 20% volume, 20% freshness)
5. Cluster — group by newsletter section headers, then by shared stemmed tokens
6. Reddit validate — targeted subreddit search + pain-framed queries (frustration, anxiety, solution-seeking angles); preserves post excerpts (title + body) for briefing display
7. Competitor check — two-pass Brave Search:
   - Pass 1 (keyword-based): GREEN/YELLOW/RED/INCONCLUSIVE on raw trend keyword. RED + no pain → SKIP immediately, no LLM call.
   - Pass 2 (build-idea-based): LLM generates 3 tool-focused queries from its build idea; Brave searches those to verify the specific product doesn't already exist. Results are **informational only** — no auto-downgrade. Luke reviews and decides.
8. Time-series enrich — `interest_over_time()` for top ~15 keywords; updates freshness score
9. Trend memory — reads last 7 days of `signals_*.json`; annotates clusters and unclustered with `days_seen`, `trajectory` (rising/stable/fading), `first_seen`, `best_day_score`; no API calls
10. Report — GPT-5.2 renames clusters by human need, generates BUILD/WATCH/SKIP decisions. Briefing order: cluster table → macro-theme story → **Reddit pain excerpts** (raw voices before LLM opinion) → build decisions (reasoning/risk first, build idea in collapsible block) → competition. Lifecycle tags (`EARLY`/`PEAKING`/`FADING`) and memory tags (`Nd ↑/→/↓`) in cluster table.

**Output:**
- `data/signals_YYYY-MM-DD.json` — full structured output (clusters + scores + Reddit + competition + `decisions` with `context_seed` for each evaluated cluster)
- `briefings/briefing_YYYY-MM-DD.md` — plain-English: cluster table → story → Reddit excerpts → BUILD/WATCH/SKIP decisions → competition

**Scheduling:** `run_daily.bat` runs via Windows Task Scheduler at 9:00 AM daily.

**Phase 2: public web tool** — when signal quality is proven over several months of private runs.
