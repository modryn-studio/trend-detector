# Development Principles

## Core Philosophy
- **Focus and solve your own problems** - You are user zero. Build for yourself first.
- **Be unique and original** - In the AI era, differentiation is your only moat.
- **Break the rules** - Convention is the enemy of breakthrough products.
- **Success is a mix of skill, timing, & luck** - Ship fast to maximize timing windows and create more at-bats for luck.

## Market Strategy
- **Start with a micro niche** - Target 100 obsessed users, not 10,000 casual ones.
- **Plan micro-to-multi-niche expansion** - Dominate one niche completely before expanding to adjacent markets.
- **Share your ideas freely** - Execution beats secrecy. Open sharing builds community and accelerates feedback loops.

## Building Approach
- **Start small. Don't think big.** - Ship one killer feature, not ten mediocre ones. Launch in days, not weeks.
- **Your enemy is perfection, BUT the first prototype must function really well** - Ugly is acceptable. Broken is not. Polish the core action ruthlessly.
- **Old World (Human Developer) = months to MVP. New World (AI-Assisted) = days to MVP** - Use time saved for user research and distribution, not more features.

## AI-First Development
Leverage these tools in every project:
1. **Machine Learning** - Personalization from day one
2. **Agent Workflows** - Automate user tasks end-to-end
3. **Agent-to-Agent Workflows** - Build autonomous multi-agent systems
4. **SDKs** - Let users extend your product
5. **Newest AI Tools** - Stay on the bleeding edge, rebuild when better tools emerge

## User Experience
- **Onboard to value in <2 minutes** - Every second to the "aha moment" matters. Remove all friction.
- **Create emotional connection** - Success metric: "They miss it when it's gone."
- **Gamify strategically** - Use competition, streaks, and points to drive early engagement. Transition to intrinsic motivation as users go deep, giving them "this is special and different" feeling.
- **People love competition** - Build competitive elements into core mechanics.

## Data & Evolution
- **Data Flywheel Hack** - Every user interaction trains your AI. Your product gets smarter daily without manual effort. This compounds exponentially.
- **Data collection for app evolution** - Instrument everything from day one. Build analytics before features.
- **Truth in data and numbers** - Watch what users DO, not just what they SAY. Combine qualitative interviews with quantitative metrics.
- **Lots of experimentation** - A/B test aggressively. Kill what doesn't work. Double down on what does.
- **Look for user feedback** - But filter for power users. Loud ≠ right.
